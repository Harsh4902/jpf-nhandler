# How to run - as JPF model checks Client, Server runs on top of the
# host JVM, on a remote server

# NOTE: our Client/Server example requires Server to run on the private host 
# "indigo.cse.yorku.ca", otherwise Client is not able to locate the server. 
# To make this run, you need to change the host name and the port according 
# to your server.
